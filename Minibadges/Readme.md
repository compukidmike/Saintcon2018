# Minibadges
The minbadge spec is here, along with eagle and kicad footprints: https://github.com/lukejenkins/minibadge  

Notes:
- 5V may not be exactly 5V. It'll probably be battery voltage (3.7-4.2V).  
- SPI *might* be connected, but don't plan on it. It gets complicated with more minibadges (one CS line per badge).  
- Please be conservative with power consumption on your minibadge. There will be a lot more minibadge spots on the badge this year, so battery life is a concern.  

If you have questions, contact me (compukidmike on twitter/slack/gmail)

## I2C Addresses
To avoid conflicts, here is the list of known minibadge I2C addresses.
To get your minibadge on this list, submit a pull request or send me a message (compukidmike on twitter/slack/gmail)
The Chip column is so I know which I2C chips to support in the main badge code (no promises, but I'm going to try to add support for as many as I can). If you're using a microcontroller, send me a spec on what I2C commands to send to it.

| Minibadge Name | Address | Chip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hakinthebox.com | 0x01 | ATTiny |
| TBA | 0x29 | ATTiny |
| compukidmike | 0x40 | ATTiny |
| Professor Plum | 0x41 | ATTiny |
| TBA | 0x42 | ATTiny |
| TBA | 0x51 | M24C01 |
| TBA | 0x52 | M24C01 |
| bashNinja | 0x53 | M24C01 |
| TBA | 0x54 | M24C01 |

## I2C Message Protocol
This is a preliminary message protocol for minibadges. You are more than welcome to come up with other means of communication and write the supporting code for the main badge. This is just a starting point... if you have ideas on expanding this, please contact me.  

### Organization of I2C Messages

- The first byte of a polling response message is the status bytes.
- The first byte of an event message is the event type byte.
- These messages are organized (by this first byte) into address spaces according to their purpose.

| Range | Purpose | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x00 - 0x3f | Badge/Minibadge | Messages between the badge and a minibadge |
| 0x40 - 0x7f | Minibadge/Minibadge | Messages from one minibadge to another (relayed by the badge) |
| 0x80 - 0xbf | Minibadge Broadcast | Messages from one minibadge to all others (relayed by the badge) |
| 0xc0 - 0xff | TBD | |


### Polling Message

Since there isnâ€™t an Interrupt line for the minibadges, the badge will poll each minibadge for a status byte (if supported by the minibadge). This polling message:

- Will occur at regular intervals (multiple times per second) 
- Badge will send a standard read message (address with R/W bit set to R) 
- The byte that is returned by the minibadge will determine what happens next

# Saintcon2018
Here's all the info you need about the 2018 Saintcon badge. You'll find badge building and flashing instructions as well as how to operate it. The Minibadges folder has info for minibadge makers.

NOTE: Female headers will be provided with the main badge this year, so minbadge makers do not need to provide their own.
